# Payday Loans Online

This app utilizes a WebView component to interface with PaydayR's lender database. It streamlines the process of reaching out to lenders that can provide highly accessible, on-demand financing in a matter of minutes. 

As its name suggests, this version of the app focuses specifically on accessing [payday loans online](http://paydayr.com), but it can also be used to submit applications for the following loan types.

- Installment Loans: A loan type that can offer more money than a traditional payday loan, and is repaid in predetermined increments over a period of a few months.
- Title Loans: A loan type that's borrowed against the value of a car or truck

**Future versions will also include the ability to apply for larger loan types, as well as peer-to-peer solutions.**

- Personal Loans: Can be up to $10,000 with a repayment period that can range from a few months, up to a year or more.
- Peer-to-Peer Loans: A flexible loan that's issued by another individual or group of individuals, rather than an institutional lender.

**A companion browser extension is also available. The project site is https://sourceforge.net/projects/paydayloansonline/**

PaydayR is constantly working through innovative initiatives to deliver the most user-friendly experience in getting payday loans online, as well as  developing the tools and resources needed for consumers to make smarter financial choices.
